# Evaluation of Jonathan Egebak Carlsen program 
Running inspector in Netbeans:
Controller.java
- Missing Javadoc times two. 

Running Metrics:
- Complexity 3 

Comments:
- Missing print out of which type of triangle it is, in the console.
- Return type should be a string, to show which triangle it is. 
- Code comments should be on it´s own line. 

# Coding standards
- Use camelCase as the text standard.
- Use english names.
